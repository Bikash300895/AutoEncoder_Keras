# AutoEncoder_Keras

Implementation of autoencoder variations
1. Simple auto encoder: Takes an image as an imput and generate same image as output
2. Deep auto encoder: This implementation has several layer deep auto encoder decoder architecture
3. CNN auto encoder: This implementaion contain convolutoinal neural network architecture
4. Denoising: Takes an noisy image as input and output its noiseless form
